    "[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (or regexes in shorthand) are essentially a language in their own and are not unique to Python.

But what if we want to search for a pattern rather than a particular word such as (xxx)xxx-xxxx where we want all the x's to be numbers? This would be a great way to find a phone number but we'd have to do a lot of Ctrl+F searches if we searched for all possibilities of 10 digit phone numbers. \n",

    "Hours can only be in the set [01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12] while minutes can range from [01 .. 59]\n",

    "So, to start off creating a regular expression to extract times, we're going to create two lists. One list is times (all positive results) and the other is not_times (all negative results). So whatever we create should find every value in the `times` variable and nothing in `not_times`. The approach of creating one list of all positives and another of all negatives is one of the best ways to create and test a regular expression to make **sure** that it is doing what you want it to do."

    "\n",
    "The file input/output (I/O) system is a mechanism that allows programs to read data from and write data to files on a computer's storage system. It provides a way to interact with files, which are persistent storage entities used to store data for later retrieval or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, including Python the file I/O system typically involves the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "`File Handling`: The process of opening, reading from, writing to, and closing files. It involves operations such as creating a file, opening an existing file, reading data from a file, writing data to a file, and closing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`File Modes`: Files can be opened in different modes, which define the intended operations on the file. Common modes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Read Mode (e.g., \"r\")`: Allows reading data from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Write Mode (e.g., \"w\")`: Allows writing data to a file, overwriting the existing contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Append Mode (e.g., \"a\")`: Allows writing data to the end of a file, preserving the existing contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Binary Mode (e.g., \"b\")`: Handles binary data, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "`File Pointers`: When reading or writing data from/to a file, a file pointer is used to keep track of the current position within the file. It determines where the next read or write operation will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reading and Writing Data`: Data can be read from a file in chunks or lines, depending on the requirements. Similarly, data can be written to a file in specified formats or structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Error Handling`: When performing file I/O operations, it is essential to handle potential errors, such as file not found, permissions issues, or disk full errors. Proper error handling ensures that the program can gracefully handle such scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file I/O system provides a way to persist data beyond the program's runtime and allows for data sharing between different programs or users. It is widely used in various applications, such as reading configuration files, logging data, processing large datasets, and storing application data."
